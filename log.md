# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Getting myself familiarized with github and the 100daysofcode challenge rules, etc.

**Thoughts:** I am not sure how to work with github 100% yet, but after this challenge I hope to be an expert.

### Day 1: January 6, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started free code camp javascript.

**Thoughts**: I started with the basics of javascript. You have to start somewhere! I don't have any code links yet.

### Day 2: January 7, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I found jsforcats.com.

**Thoughts**  The exercises really helped me with understanding the basics of variables, functions and arrays. I liked using the console in Chrome to see my results. I will probably need to go over this one again tomorrow just to make sure it sticks.

### Day 3: January 8, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: ran through tutorial on youtube. I installed visual code and node.js.

**Thoughts**  Well, I am understanding github a bit better today. The youtube video was very informative, and entering the code and looking at the results in the console was very helpful. I am no longer confused with the basics now and this video really helped to cement what I learned the past 2 days into memory. I am feeling much better now.
