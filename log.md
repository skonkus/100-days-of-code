# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Getting myself familiarized with github and the 100daysofcode challenge rules, etc.

**Thoughts:** I am not sure how to work with github 100% yet, but after this challenge I hope to be an expert.

### Day 1: January 6, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started free code camp javascript.

**Thoughts**: I started with the basics of javascript. You have to start somewhere! I don't have any code links yet.

### Day 2: January 7, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I found jsforcats.com.

**Thoughts**  The exercises really helped me with understanding the basics of variables, functions and arrays. I liked using the console in Chrome to see my results. I will probably need to go over this one again tomorrow just to make sure it sticks.
